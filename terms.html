1. TERMS OF USE
a. Welcome to www.weeblessing.com (the“Site”), a website operated by Wee Blessing, LLC. (“Wee Blessing”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). Wee Blessing offers a service that gives you access to clothing and accessories (“Products”) from the best up-and-coming labels and brands, and a number of related services (collectively, the “Services”). b. The following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) form a binding agreement between you and us, and govern your use of the Site, the Services and any Orders (defined below) that you place. c. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BY ACCESSING THE SITE, ORDERING A SHIPMENT, PURCHASING PRODUCTS, OR USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS SITE OR ORDER OR PURCHASE ANY SHIPMENTS. d. We may change, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time on a going-forward basis at our sole discretion. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Use for changes prior to use of the Site or Services, and in any event your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of any changes. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such material changes by posting notice of the changes on the Site, and/or, in our sole discretion, by email or other means. <p/>
 
 <p>
2. TYPES OF USERS
You may simply browse the Site as a “Visitor” or you may register with us to become a “Client”. You must be a Client to order shipments. <p/>
 
 <p>
3. ACCOUNTS
To become a Client, you must provide your email address and select a password (“Account Information”), which you may not transfer to or share with any third parties. We will also ask you for additional information about what you do and don’t like in order to establish your child's or children's style profile (“Style Profile”). In order that the Services work best for you, please keep your child's Style Profile up to date. Please also keep your Account Information confidential. If someone accesses our Site or Services using your Account Information, we will rely on that Account Information and will assume that it is really you who is accessing the Site and Services. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your Account Information and all activities (including Orders -- as defined below) that occur under or in connection with your Account. Without limiting any rights that we may otherwise have, we reserve the right to take any and all action we deem necessary to ensure the security of the Services and your Account, including without limitation terminating your Account, changing your password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your Account. You agree to be responsible for any act or omission of any users that access the Services under your Account Information that, if undertaken by you, would be deemed a violation of these Terms of Use. You may not use anyone else's Account at any time, without the permission of the Account holder. Please notify us immediately if you become aware that your Account Information is being used without authorization. You agree not to register for more than one Account, register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than yourself without such individual’s authorization, or register for an Account on behalf of any group or entity. You must be at least 18 years old to be a Client. If we later discover or suspect that a person under 18 years old has requested a shipment (defined below), we reserve the right to take steps to cancel that request. <p/>
 
 <p>
4. BLESSING SHIPMENTS AND RETURNS
a. Blessing Shipments. From time to time, we will contact you and offer you a shipment. When you choose to receive a shipment, we will send you some Products chosen by Wee Blessing. Your child will be able to try them on in your own home and see what you like. You can decide to keep all, some or none of the Products in your shipment, and we will bill you for the ones you keep as described in this Section. b. Scheduling. If you are a Client, you may schedule a shipment through the Site. We’ll try to accommodate your request, but the dates are estimates and not guaranteed. You may also request that we automatically send you a shipment, without waiting for you to schedule it. If you order any shipment, whether manually or automatically (in either case, an “Order”), you authorize us to charge you for the shipment in accordance with these Terms of Use. You may cancel your shipment with a 30 day notice. You are however required to subscribe to automatic shipments for at least 60 days. As explained in this Section, you are responsible for: (i) the Fee for any shipment that is not canceled with the required notice and (ii) the price of any Products that are not returned in accordance with our policies. These Terms of Use will govern any shipment. We may refuse to ship to any address for any reason including because it is outside the geographic area that we serve (currently only the United States) or it is to an address that we determine has a history of fraudulent purchases. c. Returns. If you want to return any of the Products in your shipment, simply place them in the return package we provide and mail them back to us at no cost to you. Any returned products must be postmarked no later than ten (10) days after you receive the package (the “Return Date”). We will assume that you have chosen to keep any Products in the shipment that you do not postmark back to us one week following the Return Date, and we will charge your Account for those Products anytime after that day. Any exceptions permitting a return postmarked longer than one week after the Return Date must be requested in a timely manner and may be granted at the sole discretion of Wee Blessing. Products must be returned unworn and in the original condition. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to exchange or replace any item. d. Legal Details. OUR SCHEDULING OF A SHIPMENT IS AN OFFER TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCT(S) IN THE SHIPMENT, WHICH YOU MAY RETRACT BY RETURNING THE PRODUCTS YOU DON’T WANT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE MAY ACCEPT YOUR REQUEST FOR A SHIPMENT BY PROCESSING YOUR PAYMENT OF THE SHIPPING FEE (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND SHIPPING YOU THE SHIPMENT. For any reason, we may decline to accept your request for a shipment. If we decline to accept your request for a shipment, we may attempt to notify you at the email address you provided. All Products will be deemed accepted by you upon shipment, and title to and risk of loss passes to you when we provide the Product(s) to a common carrier.<p/>
 
 <p>
5. SHIPPING FEE AND PAYMENT
When we ship you a shipment, we will charge you a non-refundable “Shipping Fee” in the amount set forth on the Site. The Shipping Fee will be charged to your credit card or other payment method between the time the Order is placed and we ship your shipment. However, if you choose to keep Products from your shipment, the Shipping Fee will not serve as a credit towards the purchase of any clothing. To pay for an Order, you will need to provide Wee Blessing with the information necessary to process an Order from you, including your shipping address and the billing information requested to pay for such Order. You may pay for the Shipping Fee and any Products from your Order via credit card or other manner accepted by Wee Blessing.  By submitting your payment information to us, you authorize us to charge the applicable payment method at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of the Return Date unless we otherwise notify you. You represent that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary authorization to do so. We will not be liable in the event your children or others acting with or without your permission use your credit card, PayPal account, or other means of payment to make Orders on the Site; however you may report any unauthorized use to us, and we will use reasonable measures within our control to help prevent future unauthorized use of your card. <p/>
 
 <p>
6. PRICING AND PRODUCTS
Wee Blessing does not disclose the prices of its Products until you receive a shipment. While Wee Blessing makes efforts to follow the style and price preferences you express for your child in your Styling Profile, we do not guarantee that every item in your shipment will comply with those preferences. If you don’t like it, send it back in accordance with Section 3. Please remember that you are responsible for paying the price of any and all Products in your shipment, whether they conform to your Style Profile or not, unless you return the Products by the Return Date. You are responsible for the payment of any Shipping Fees, and state and local sales taxes that apply to your Order where we elect or are required to collect and remit such taxes. If we don’t collect the applicable sales tax, you are you responsible to pay the applicable use taxes. The manufacturer of each Product, and not Wee Blessing is responsible for the quality and any warranty of any of its Products shipped or purchased from Wee Blessing. If you have any problems with an Order, you should first contact Wee Blessing by email at weeblessing@gmail.com and we will put you in touch with the right person to handle it.<p/>
 
 <p>
7. REFERRAL PROGRAM
a. As a Client, by referring your friends to Wee Blessing, you may participate in the Wee Blessing Referral Program (the “Program”). If you refer a friend and they sign up as a monthly subscriber to our service for at least 90 days, you will receive a monetary gift credit to be used towards your next Order. This gift credit may change at any time and for any reason without notice. This gift credit will have a retail value of $25. You are not limited to the number of friends that you refer to our program currently. b. We reserve the right to put restrictions on the Program, to suspend or terminate the Program and to void any Referral gift credits upon notice to you. We may provide such notice in any way compliant with applicable law including via email to the last email address you provided to us, by amending these terms or posting a change to the Program on our Referral Program FAQ page. All Referral Gifts Credits are voided immediately upon termination of this Agreement. <p/>

 <p>
20. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE
A. All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Wee Blessing arising out of, under, or related to these Terms of Use or our privacy practices (including any action we take or authorize with respect to information about or provided by you) will be settled exclusively through binding arbitration. B. ARBITRATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND NOT ANY STATE ARBITRATION LAW. C. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by these Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). D. You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. E. You and Wee Blessing must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing; (b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to -face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and Wee Blessing, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; (c) the arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory; (d) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR WEE BLESSING MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (e) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING; (f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Wee Blessing will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (g) Wee Blessing also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (h) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Wee Blessing will be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Wee Blessing customer; and (j) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses. F. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Wee Blessing may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret will not be subject to this arbitration provision. Such claims will be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in Columbus, Georgia. Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate. G. With the exception of subparts (E)(d) and (e) in Sub-paragraph 20.E. hereof (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (E)(d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor Wee Blessing will be entitled to arbitration. In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Wee Blessing will be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts in Columbus, Georgia. H. For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.<p/>

Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. These Terms of Use constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Terms of Use will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be governed, in all respects, by the laws of the State of Georgia.<p/>
