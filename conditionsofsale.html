These Terms are subject to change by Wee Blessing without prior written notice at any time, in our sole discretion.

You should review these Terms prior to purchasing any Products or Services that are available through this Site. Your continued use of this Site after the "Last Updated Date" will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to such changes.

Users; Opening an Account
You may browse or review various pages on the Site as a guest (hereinafter, a “Visitor”). However, you must register with us and create an account (hereafter, an “Account”) to order shipments. To establish an Account and become a client of Wee Blessing (hereinafter, a “Client”), you must provide your email address and select a password (hereinafter “Account Information”). We will also ask you for additional information concerning your preferences which will be used to create your child's or children's style profile (the “Style Profile”). For our Services to work best for you, please keep your child's Style Profile up to date in order to ensure satisfaction. You must keep your Account Information confidential and are not permitted to share it with another person or any other third-party. If someone besides you accesses our Site or Services using your Account Information, we will rely on that Account Information and will assume that it is really you who is accessing the Site and Services. You are solely responsible for the use of your Account Information and all activities (including Orders) that occur under or in connection with your Account. Without limiting any rights that we may otherwise have, we reserve the right to take any and all action we deem necessary to ensure the security of the Services and your Account, including without limitation terminating your Account, changing your password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your Account. You agree to be responsible for any act or omission of any users that access the Services under your Account Information that, if undertaken by you, would be deemed a violation of these Terms of Use. You may not use anyone else's Account at any time, without the permission of the Account holder. Please notify us immediately if you become aware that your Account Information is being used without authorization. You agree not to register for more than one Account, register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than yourself without such individual’s authorization, or register for an Account on behalf of any group or entity. You must be at least 18 years old to be a Client. If we later discover or suspect that a person under 18 years old has requested a shipment (defined below), we reserve the right to take steps to cancel that request.
Order Acceptance and Cancellation. You agree that your decision to subscribe to our Site (hereinafter, an “Order”) is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all Products and Services listed in your Order. All Orders must be accepted by us or we will not be obligated to sell the Products or Services to you. We may choose not to accept Orders at our sole discretion, even after we send you a confirmation email with your Order number and details of the items you have ordered. 
Prices and Payment Terms. 
All prices, discounts, and promotions posted on this Site are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the Order is placed and will be set out in your Order confirmation email. Price increases will only apply to Orders placed after such changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges if applicable will be added to your merchandise total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your Order confirmation email. We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any Orders arising from such occurrences.
We may offer from time to time promotions on the Site that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern. 
Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and payment must be received by us before our acceptance of an Order. We accept American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa for all purchases. You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any, regardless of the amount quoted on the Site at the time of your Order. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing governing terms for payment, we do not accept any “prepaid” or “reloadable” cards for the payment of goods or servicing on the Website including, but not limited to, general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) prepaid cards for payment, electronic benefits transfer (“EBT”) cards; payroll or employer benefit cards; gift cards, regardless of the issuing company, bank or network brands (including, but not limited to, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, or Visa); financial aid cards for students; transit cards; travel cards; or any other card that does not qualify as a “credit card” or “debit card” as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Shipments; Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss. 
When we ship you a shipment, we will charge you a non-refundable shipping fee (the “Shipping Fee”) in the amount set forth on the Site. The Shipping Fee will be charged to your credit card or other payment method between the time the Order is placed and we ship your shipment. However, if you choose to keep Products from your shipment, the Shipping Fee will not serve as a credit towards the purchase of any clothing. To pay for an Order, you will need to provide Wee Blessing with the information necessary to process an Order from you, including your shipping address and the billing information requested to pay for such Order. You may pay for the Shipping Fee and any Products from your Order via credit card or other manner accepted by Wee Blessing.  By submitting your payment information to us, you authorize us to charge the applicable payment method at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of the Return Date unless we otherwise notify you. You represent that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary authorization to do so. We will not be liable in the event your children or others acting with or without your permission use your credit card, PayPal account, or other means of payment to make Orders on the Site; however you may report any unauthorized use to us, and we will use reasonable measures within our control to help prevent future unauthorized use of your card. 
From time to time, we will contact you and offer you a shipment of Products. When you choose to receive a shipment, we will send you some Products chosen by Wee Blessing. Your child will be able to try them on in your own home and see what you like. You can decide to keep all, some or none of the Products in your shipment, and we will bill you for the ones you keep as described in this Section.
. If you are a Client, you may schedule a shipment through the Site. We’ll try to accommodate your request, but the dates are estimates and not guaranteed. You may also request that we automatically send you a shipment, without waiting for you to schedule it. If you order any shipment, whether manually or automatically, you authorize us to charge you for the shipment in accordance with these Terms of Use. You may cancel your shipment with a thirty (30) day notice. You are however required to subscribe to automatic shipments for at least thrity (30) days.
We will arrange for shipment of the Products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process. Shipping and handling charges are reimbursement for the costs we incur in the processing, handling, packing, shipping, and delivery of your Order. 
Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the Products to the carrier/delivery (“FOB”, Place of Shipment). Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.
Pricing and Products. Wee Blessing does not disclose the prices of its Products until you receive a shipment. While Wee Blessing makes efforts to follow the style and price preferences you express for your child in your Styling Profile, we do not guarantee that every item in your shipment will comply with those preferences. If you don’t like it, send it back in accordance with Section 7. Please remember that you are responsible for paying the price of any and all Products in your shipment, whether they conform to your Style Profile or not, unless you return the Products by the Return Date (as defined below). You are responsible for the payment of any Shipping Fees, and state and local sales taxes that apply to your Order where we elect or are required to collect and remit such taxes. If we don’t collect the applicable sales tax, you are solely responsible to pay the applicable use taxes. The manufacturer of each Product, and not Wee Blessing is responsible for the quality and any warranty of any of its Products shipped or purchased from Wee Blessing. If you have any problems with an Order, you should first contact Wee Blessing by email at  and we will put you in touch with the right person to handle it.
Returns and Refunds. Except for any Products designated on the Site as final sale or non-returnable, we will accept a return of Products contained within an Order for a refund of your purchase price, less the original shipping and handling costs, provided such return is made within ten (10) days of delivery (the “Return Date”) with valid proof of purchase and provided such Products are returned in their original condition. For a return to be rendered timely, the returned item(s) must be postmarked by the Return Date. It will be assumed that the items have been accepted by you if you fail to postmark any return by the Return Date. To return Products beyond the Return Date, you must call 1-(800)-441-0568 or email us at alicia@weeblessing.com to obtain express, written consent to the return before shipping your product. Any request to return an item beyond the ten (10) day deadline must be done before the expiration of the deadline. No returns of any type after this deadline will be accepted without the express written consent of Wee Blessing, LLC.
You are responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned items unless otherwise specified. You bear the risk of loss during shipment. We therefore strongly recommend that you fully insure your return shipment against loss or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery for your protection. 
Refunds are processed within approximately five (5) business days of our receipt of your merchandise. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original purchase on the Site. WE OFFER NO REFUNDS ON ANY PRODUCTS DESIGNATED ON THIS SITE AS NON-RETURNABLE.
For defective returns, please refer to the manufacturer's warranty (see Section 9) included with the product or as detailed in the product's description on our Site.
Referral Program. As a Client, you may participate in the Wee Blessing Referral Program (the “Program”) by referring your friends to Wee Blessing. If you refer a friend and they sign up as a monthly subscriber to our service for at least ninety (90) days you will receive a $25.00 credit toward your account. This gift may change at any time and for any reason without notice. This gift outfit will have a retail value up to sixty dollars ($60.00). This outfit will be shipped to you within your next two (2) scheduled shipments. You are not limited to the number of friends that you refer to our Program currently.
We reserve the right to put restrictions on the Program, to suspend or terminate the Program and to void any Referral gifts upon notice to you. We may provide such notice in any way compliant with applicable law including via email to the last email address you provided to us, by amending these Terms or posting a change to the Program on the Referral Program FAQ page of our Site.
